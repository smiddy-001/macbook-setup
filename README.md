# Rileys magnificant macbook setup script

assuming the latest mac version, simply run in the terminal
```bash
git clone ... ~/Desktop
bash ~/Desktop/macbook-setpup/setup.sh
```

**DO NOT PAUSE INSTALLATION, CTR-C OR CLOSE OR OPEN ANY TERMINALS, GO MAKE A COFFEE OR SOMETHING**

or a one-liner if you really trust me (installs and removes itself) you will see a weird filename on the desktop

```bash
git clone ... ~/Desktop && mkdir -p ~/Desktop/installerscript123456789123456789 && bash ~/Desktop/installerscript123456789123456789/macbook-setpup/setup.sh && rm -rf ~/Desktop/installerscript123456789123456789/macbook-setpup/
```

where ... is whatever the git clone link url is

should be pretty safe to do without any bad repucussions, **disable the sign in with password** I would highly reccomend not doing this bit...
